# TiLP - Texas Instruments Linking Program
## Homebrew Tap
This is a homebrew tap containing a few libraries and a program (TiLP) for connecting to and working with Texas Instruments calculators. 

I don't maintain the software itself, just the homebrew tap for making installation on Mac OSX easier. 

The software itself was created by these lovely people: [http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/index.html](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/index.html)
